# Depression Tweets Analysis ðŸ“Š

> Depression is a common illness worldwide, with more than 264 million people affected. Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional 
responses to challenges in everyday life. Especially when long-lasting and with moderate or severe intensity, depression may become a serious health condition. 
It can cause the affected person to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. 
Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds. <br>
